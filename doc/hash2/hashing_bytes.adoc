# Hashing Byte Sequences
:idprefix: hashing_bytes_

This library addresses two major use cases: hashing an untyped sequence
of bytes, and hashing {cpp} objects.

Untyped byte sequences (also called _messages_) are hashed by passing
them to a _hash algorithm_, which then produces a hash value (or a
_message digest_).

The same _hash algorithm_, when passed the same _message_, will always
produce the same _digest_. (Published algorithms provide _message_ and
corresponding _digest_ pairs, called _test vectors_, to enable
verification of independent implementations.)

(To hash a {cpp} object, it's first converted (serialized) to a sequence
of bytes, then passed to a _hash algorithm_.)

## Hash Algorithm Requirements

A _hash algorithm_ must have the following structure, and meet the
following minimum requirements:

```
struct HashAlgorithm
{
    using result_type = /*integral or array-like*/;

    static constexpr int block_size = /*...*/; // optional

    HashAlgorithm();
    explicit HashAlgorithm( std::uint64_t seed );
    HashAlgorithm( unsigned char const* seed, std::size_t n );

    HashAlgorithm( HashAlgorithm const& r );
    HashAlgorithm& operator=( HashAlgorithm const& r );

    void update( void const* data, std::size_t n );

    result_type result();
};
```

### result_type

The nested type `result_type` is the type of the produced hash value. It
can be an unsigned integer type (that is not `bool`), typically
`std::uint32_t` or `std::uint64_t`, or a `std::array`-like type with a
value type of `unsigned char`.

Normally, non-cryptographic hash functions have an integer `result_type`,
and cryptographic hash functions have an array-like `result_type`, but
that's not required.

The provided utility function `get_integral_result` can be used to obtain
an integer hash value from any valid `result_type`.

### block_size

Cryptographic hash functions provide a `block_size` value, which is their
block size (e.g. 64 for MD5, 128 for SHA2-512) and is required in order
to implement the corresponding https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC[HMAC].

`block_size` is an optional requirement.

### Default Constructor

All _hash algorithms_ must be default constructible. The default
constructor initializes the internal state of the hash algorithm to its
initial values, as published in its specification.

For example, the default constructor of `md5_128` corresponds to calling
the function `MD5_Init` of the reference implementation.

### Constructor Taking an Integer Seed

All _hash algorithms_ must be constructible from a value of type
`std::uint64_t`, which serves as a seed.

Using a seed value of 0 is equivalent to default construction.

Distinct seed values cause the internal state to be initialized differently,
and therefore, instances of the hash algorithm initialized by different seeds
produce different hash values when passed the same message.

Seeding using random (unobservable from the outside) values is useful for
preventing https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_attack#Hash_flooding[hash flooding attacks].

### Constructor Taking a Byte Sequence Seed

All _hash algorithms_ can be constructed from a seed sequence of
`unsigned char` values (this makes all hash algorithms
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyed_hash_function[keyed hash functions].)

A null sequence (one with length 0) produces a default-constructed instance.

Different seed sequences produce differently initialized instances.

While this requirement makes all hash algorithms usable as MACs
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_authentication_code[Message Authentication Codes]),
you should as a general rule prefer an established MAC algorithm, such as
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC[HMAC]. (A HMAC implementation is provided.)

### Copy Constructor, Copy Assignment

Hash algorithms are copy constructible and copy assignable, providing the
usual guarantees for these operations. That is, a copy is equivalent to the
original.

### update

The function `update` is the mechanism by which the input message is provided
to the hash algorithm.

Calling `update` several times is equivalent to calling it once with the
concatenated byte sequences from the individual calls. That is, the input
message may be provided in parts, and the way it's split into parts does
not matter and does not affect the final hash value.

Given
```
Hash hash; // some hash algorithm
unsigned char message[6] = { /*...*/ }; // some input message
```
the following `update` call
```
hash.update( message, 6 );
```
is equivalent to
```
hash.update( message, 4 );
hash.update( message + 4, 2 );
```
and to
```
for( int i = 0; i < 6; ++i ) hash.update( &message[i], 1 );
```

### result

After the entire input message has been provided via calls to `update`, the
final hash value can be obtained by calling `result`.

The call to `result` finalizes the internal state, by padding the message as
per the concrete algorithm specification, by optionally incorporating the
length of the message into the state, and by performing finalization
operations on the state, again as specified by the concrete algorithm.

A final hash value is then obtained by transforming the internal state, and
returned.

Note that `result` is non-const, because it changes the internal state. It's
allowed for `result` to be called more than once; subsequent calls perform
the state finalization again and as a result produce a pseudorandom sequence
of `result_type` values. This can be used to effectively extend the output of
the hash function. For example, a 256 bit result can be obtained from a hash
algorithm whose `result_type` is 64 bit, by calling `result` four times.

As a toy example, _not intended for production use_, this is how one could
write a random number generator on top of the FNV-1a implementation provided
by the library:

```
std::uint64_t random()
{
    static boost::hash2::fnv1a_64 hash;
    return hash.result();
}
```

## Compile Time Hashing

Under {cpp}14, it's possible to invoke some hash algorithms at compile time.
These algorithms provide the following interface:

```
struct HashAlgorithm
{
    using result_type = /*integral or array-like*/;

    static constexpr int block_size = /*...*/; // optional

    constexpr HashAlgorithm();
    explicit constexpr HashAlgorithm( std::uint64_t seed );
    constexpr HashAlgorithm( unsigned char const* seed, std::size_t n );

    constexpr HashAlgorithm( HashAlgorithm const& r );
    constexpr HashAlgorithm& operator=( HashAlgorithm const& r );

    void update( void const* data, std::size_t n );
    constexpr void update( unsigned char const* data, std::size_t n );

    constexpr result_type result();
};
```

Apart from the added `constexpr` qualifiers, the only difference is that
`update` has a second overload that takes `unsigned char const*` instead
of `void const*`. (Pointers to `void` cannot be used in `constexpr` functions
before {cpp}26.)

## Provided Hash Algorithms

### FNV-1a

The https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fowler%E2%80%93Noll%E2%80%93Vo_hash_function[Fowler-Noll-Vo hash function]
is provided as a representative of the class of hash functions that process
their output one byte at a time. The 32 or 64 bit state is updated for each
input character `ch` by using the operation `state = (state ^ ch) * fnv_prime`.

FNV-1a is non-cryptographic, relatively weak compared to state of the art
hash functions (but good for its class), but fast when the input strings
are short.

### xxHash

### SipHash

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SipHash[SipHash] (https://eprint.iacr.org/2012/351[paper]) has been designed to thwart
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_attack#Hash_flooding[hash flooding attacks] against hash tables that receive
external untrusted input (e.g. HTTP message headers, or JSON objects.)

It's not a cryptographic hash function (even though its design is similar to one),
because it does not provide collision resistance when the initial seed is known.

It is, however, a cryptographically strong keyed hash function (or a pseudorandom function, PRF).
If the initial seed is unknown to the attacker, it's computationally difficult to engineer a collision, or to recover the seed by observing the output.

SipHash has been adopted as the de-facto standard hash function for hash tables that can be exposed to external input,
and is used in Python, Perl, Ruby, Rust, and other languages.

SipHash is the recommended hash function for hash tables exposed to external input. As a best practice, it should be seeded with a random value that varies per connection, and not a fixed one per process.

### MD5

Designed in 1991 by Ron Rivest, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5[MD5] used
to be the best known and the most widely used https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function[cryptographic hash function],
but has been broken and is no longer considered cryptographic for any purposes.
It produces a 128 bit digest.

MD5 should no longer be used in new code, except when implementing an existing
specification or protocol that calls for its use.

Prefer SHA2-512/224 (or SHA2-224 in 32 bit code) instead.

### SHA-1

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1[SHA-1] is a cryptographic hash function that was designed by NSA and published
by https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIST[NIST]
as a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Information_Processing_Standards[Federal Information Processing Standard] (FIPS).
It produces a 160 bit digest.

SHA-1 is now considered insecure against a well-funded attacker, and should no
longer be used in new code. Prefer SHA2-512/224, SHA2-224 in 32 bit code, or, if
you require a digest of exactly 160 bits, RIPEMD-160 instead.

### SHA-2

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2[SHA-2] is a family of cryptographic hash functions, also designed by NSA and published by NIST in 2001.
It includes SHA2-224, SHA2-256, SHA2-384, SHA2-512, SHA2-512/224, and SHA2-512/256, each producing a digest with the corresponding bit length.

Of these, SHA2-256 and SHA2-512 are the basis ones, and the rest are variants with the digest truncated.

The SHA-2 functions haven't been broken and are in wide use, despite the existence of a newer standard (SHA-3).

SHA2-256 and its truncated variant SHA2-224 use 32 bit operations and therefore do not lose performance on a 32 bit platform.

SHA2-512 and its truncated variants SHA2-384, SHA2-512/224, and SHA2-512/256 use 64 bit operations and are approximately twice as fast
as SHA2-256 on a 64 bit platform, but slower in 32 bit code.

On 64 bit platforms, SHA2-512/256 and SHA2-512/224 should be preferred over SHA2-256 and SHA2-224 not just because of speed, but because
they are resistant to length extension attacks as they don't expose all of the bits of their internal state in the final digest.

### RIPEMD-160

Designed in 1996, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIPEMD[RIPEMD-160] is a cryptographic hash function that was less well known than MD5 and SHA-1,
but that has recently become popular because of its use in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

Even though it hasn't been broken, there's no reason to prefer its use in new code over SHA-2.
